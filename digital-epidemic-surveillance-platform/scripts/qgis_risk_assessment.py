# ==============================================================================
# Standalone PyQGIS Script for Automated Risk Assessment
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script is a placeholder for the advanced GIS automation detailed in
# Chapter 11 of "The Digital Epidemic".
#
# PURPOSE:
# To automatically perform a knowledge-driven Weighted Linear Combination (WLC)
# risk assessment using a set of raster input layers.
#
# HOW TO RUN:
# This script is intended to be run in an environment where the PyQGIS
# libraries are accessible. It requires a local QGIS installation.
#
# See the book manuscript for the full implementation details, including
# how to set up the QGIS environment and define the input parameters.

import sys

# --- USER-DEFINED PARAMETERS ---
# In the full script, these would be configured by the user.

# IMPORTANT: This path must be changed to your local QGIS installation
QGIS_INSTALL_PATH = '/usr' # Example for Linux; 'C:/Program Files/QGIS 3.28.3' for Windows
