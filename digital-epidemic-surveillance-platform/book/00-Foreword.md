# Foreword

---

The health of our livestock is inextricably linked to the health of our environment and our communities. A drought in the pastoral lands can trigger mass migrations that spread disease across borders. A change in vegetation patterns can create new habitats for disease vectors. For years, the concept of "One Health" has been a guiding principle, but our surveillance systems have often remained siloed, unable to integrate these critical environmental and ecological datasets into our daily work.

This book marks a turning point. "The Digital Epidemic" provides the first comprehensive blueprint for a surveillance platform truly built on One Health principles. By masterfully integrating the immense power of Google Earth Engine, the author shows us how to move beyond simply tracking cases and begin monitoring the environmental drivers of disease risk.

The dashboards presented here—for monitoring seasonal drought, vector suitability, and land cover change—are not just innovative; they are essential. They transform our surveillance posture from reactive to proactive. They allow us to ask not just "Where is the disease now?" but "Where is the risk likely to emerge next?" This capability is a game-changer for allocating resources, targeting interventions, and preventing outbreaks before they start.

Furthermore, the platform's architecture is inherently collaborative. By standardizing data from outbreak investigations, vaccination campaigns, and laboratory diagnostics into a single, accessible system, it creates a common operational picture for everyone from field veterinarians to ministry officials to international partners.

This book is more than a technical manual for animal health; it is a foundational text for the future of One Health in practice. It provides the tools and the vision needed to build surveillance systems that are as holistic and interconnected as the ecosystems we strive to protect. It is essential reading for anyone working at the critical interface of animal, human, and environmental health.
